Meeting number 2

Price model?

Pricing on-line?

Create project so that it can be enhanced by another group...

Requirements for both pricing model, and pricing on-line.

Price decay online....

How do you classify what goes on-line versus in the store?

...originally everything was supposed to go on-line first.  Good condition stuff, named-brand, photograph well goes on-line first.  Less than 10% qualifies on these conditions.  More consigners coming in than they can handle...  Handle 5 drop-off a day, but they got 30.  Minimum price is hard to quantify.  $1.00 minimum price?

On-line people who do the same thing...

Categorization of items in database.

scope....?  Do we need to keep things on the rack longer?  Understand what sells things...

Elastic search ... Kibana

Web presence hasn't gotten as much attention.

Meeting number 3, 11/17/2017

1. Data was entered with custom tool, not MS Access...custom build form?
...not even connected to the Internet XP machine

2. They are happy with the data entry.

3. Two existing web applications for data entry

4. ElasticSearch allows entry...

ElasticSearch is a database.

Bring databases together?

Goal is to maximize revenue...

Inflation may not be a factor due to how clothing is priced now.

30% of sales are on credit...

Can't differentiate between bargain bin sale and donated to charity.

700 ITEMS sold, 300 ITEMS donated.

30 days in store, things go to donation.

Categories as granular as the categories in MS Access...

Seasonality: Summer versus not summer.

50 cents for $9.99 items -> $4.50 or $5.50.

8% of credit expires....it expires after 3 years.

- Look at consigner number for newness....600 for consigner number.
|
- 999 might be how Sue coded new items.
|
- Drop the new items from the model!

***********************

Price distribution per category, remove high-end outliers.  Low-end outliers went to the bargain bin, or to donation.

sales performance of items per category per price point...

$3.99, number of items, amount of time in store
$4.99, number of items, amount of time in store
$5.99, number of items, amount of time in store...

Dollar per day held in inventory?...

Seasonality matters...

Shorts sell better in summer
Long-sleeve shirts in winter
Boots on rainy days

1) PRICE; AND; 2) TIME ON SHELF ARE THE TWO THINGS THAT THEY CONTROL!

Look into price elasticity...

They pay their employees slightly more.

Segmenting consignors?...Consignors who ONLY use their their credit are the least valuable.  Those who never spend their credit, or
who use the credit, and spend MORE are more valuable.
